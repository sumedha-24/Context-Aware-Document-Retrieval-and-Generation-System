While today\\u2019s MRSs\\nconsiderably help users to \\ufb01nd interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges.\\nIn particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond\\nsimple user\\u2013item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences,\\nand intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse.

Thanks to music streaming services\\nlike Spotify, Pandora, or Apple Music, music a\\ufb01cionados\\nare nowadays given access to tens of millions music pieces.\\nBy \\ufb01ltering this abundance of music items, thereby limiting\\nchoice overload [20], MRSs are often very successful to sug-\\ngest songs that \\ufb01t their users\\u2019 preferences. However, such\\nsystems are still far from being perfect and frequently pro-\\nduce unsatisfactory recommendations. This is partly because\\nof the fact that users\\u2019 tastes and musical needs are highly\\ndependent on a multitude of factors, which are not considered\\nin suf\\ufb01cient depth in current MRS approaches, which are typ-\\nically centered on the core concept of user\\u2013item interactions,\\nor sometimes content-based item descriptors.

It there-\\nfore does not come as a surprise that emotion regulation\\nwas identi\\ufb01ed as one of the main reasons why people lis-\\nten to music [122,155]. As an example, people may listen to\\ncompletely different musical genres or styles when they are\\nsad in comparison with when they are happy. Indeed, prior\\nresearch on music psychology discovered that people may\\nchoose the type of music which moderates their emotional\\ncondition [109]. More recent \\ufb01ndings show that music can be\\nmainly chosen so as to augment the emotional situation per-\\nceived by the listener [131]. In order to build emotion-aware\\nMRS, it is therefore necessary to (i) infer the emotional state\\nthe listener is in, (ii) infer emotional concepts from the music\\nitself, and (iii) understand how these two interrelate. These\\nthree tasks are detailed below.\\nEliciting the emotional state of the listener Similar to per-\\nsonality traits, the emotional state of a user can be elicited\\nexplicitlyorimplicitly.Intheformercase,theuseristypically\\npresented one of the various categorical models (emotions\\nare described by distinct emotion words such as happiness,\\nsadness, anger, or fear) [84,191] or dimensional models\\n(emotions are described by scores with respect to two or\\nthree dimensions, e.g., valence and arousal) [152]. For a\\nmore detailed elaboration on emotion models in the context\\nof music, we refer to [159,186]. The implicit acquisition of\\nemotional states can be effected, for instance, by analyzing\\nuser-generated text [49], speech [66], or facial expressions\\nin video [55].\\nEmotion tagging in music The music piece itself can be\\nregarded as an emotion-laden content and in turn can be\\ndescribed by emotion words. The task of automatically\\nassigning such emotion words to a music piece is an active\\nresearch area, often refereed to as music emotion recogni-\\ntion (MER), e.g., [14,91,103,187,188,191]. How to integrate\\nsuch emotion terms created by MER tools into a MRS is,\\nhowever, not an easy task, for several reasons.

This is motivated by the\\nassumption that, for instance, a rating prediction of 1 when\\nthe true rating is 4 is much more severe than a prediction of\\n3 for the same item.\\nPrecision at top K recommendations (P@K) is a common\\nmetric that measures the accuracy of the system in command-\\ning relevant items. In order to compute P@K, for each user,\\nthe top K recommended items whose ratings also appear\\nin the test set T are considered. This metric was originally\\ndesigned for binary relevance judgments. Therefore, in case\\nof availability of relevance information at different levels,\\nsuch as a \\ufb01ve-point Likert scale, the labels should be bina-\\nrized, e.g., considering the ratings greater than or equal to 4\\n(out of 5) as relevant. For each user u, Pu@K is computed\\nas follows:\\nPu@K = |Lu \\u2229\\u02c6\\nLu|\\n| \\u02c6\\nLu|\\n(3)\\nwhere Lu is the set of relevant items for user u in the test\\nset T and \\u02c6\\nLu denotes the recommended set containing the\\nK items in T with the highest predicted ratings for the user\\nu. The overall P@K is then computed by averaging Pu@K\\nvalues for all users in the test set.\\nMeanaverageprecisionattopKrecommendations(MAP@K)\\nis a rank-based metric that computes the overall precision of\\nthe system at different lengths of recommendation lists. MAP\\nis computed as the arithmetic mean of the average precision\\nover the entire set of users in the test set. Average precision\\nfor the top K recommendations (AP@K) is de\\ufb01ned as fol-\\nlows:\\nAP@K = 1\\nN\\nK\\n\\u0002\\ni=1\\nP@i \\u00b7 rel(i)\\n(4)\\nwhere rel(i) is an indicator signaling if the ith recommended\\nitem is relevant, i.e., rel(i) = 1, or not, i.e., rel(i) = 0; N\\nis the total number of relevant items. Note that MAP implic-\\nitly incorporates recall, because it also considers the relevant\\nitems not in the recommendation list.17\\nRecall at top K recommendations (R@K) is presented here\\nfor the sake of completeness, even though it is not a crucial\\nmeasure from a consumer\\u2019s perspective. Indeed, the listener\\nis typically not interested in being recommended all or a large\\nnumber of relevant items, rather in having good recommen-\\ndations at the top of the recommendation list. For a user u,\\nRu@K is de\\ufb01ned as:\\n17 Weshouldnotethatintherecommendersystemscommunity,another\\nvariation of average precision is gaining popularity recently, formally\\nde\\ufb01ned by: AP@K =\\n1\\nmin(K,N)\\n\\u0006K\\ni=1 P@i \\u00b7 rel(k) in which N is the\\ntotal number of relevant items and K is the size of recommendation\\nlist. The motivation behind the minimization term is to prevent the AP\\nscores to be unfairly suppressed when the number of recommendations\\nis too low to capture all the relevant items. This variation of MAP was\\npopularized by Kaggle competitions [97] about recommender systems\\nand has been used in several other research works, consider for exam-\\nple [8,124].\\n123\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

Thanks to music streaming services\\nlike Spotify, Pandora, or Apple Music, music a\\ufb01cionados\\nare nowadays given access to tens of millions music pieces.\\nBy \\ufb01ltering this abundance of music items, thereby limiting\\nchoice overload [20], MRSs are often very successful to sug-\\ngest songs that \\ufb01t their users\\u2019 preferences. However, such\\nsystems are still far from being perfect and frequently pro-\\nduce unsatisfactory recommendations. This is partly because\\nof the fact that users\\u2019 tastes and musical needs are highly\\ndependent on a multitude of factors, which are not considered\\nin suf\\ufb01cient depth in current MRS approaches, which are typ-\\nically centered on the core concept of user\\u2013item interactions,\\nor sometimes content-based item descriptors. In contrast, we\\n4\\nDepartment of Computer Science, Politecnico di Milano,\\nMilan, Italy\\n5\\nFree University of Bozen-Bolzano, Bolzano, Italy\\n123\\n\",\n          \"108\\nInternational Journal of Multimedia Information Retrieval (2018) 7:95\\u2013116\\nFig. 1 Evaluation framework of the user experience for recommender systems, according to [108]\\nmusic has a strong in\\ufb02uence on our emotional state. It there-\\nfore does not come as a surprise that emotion regulation\\nwas identi\\ufb01ed as one of the main reasons why people lis-\\nten to music [122,155]. As an example, people may listen to\\ncompletely different musical genres or styles when they are\\nsad in comparison with when they are happy. Indeed, prior\\nresearch on music psychology discovered that people may\\nchoose the type of music which moderates their emotional\\ncondition [109]. More recent \\ufb01ndings show that music can be\\nmainly chosen so as to augment the emotional situation per-\\nceived by the listener [131]. In order to build emotion-aware\\nMRS, it is therefore necessary to (i) infer the emotional state\\nthe listener is in, (ii) infer emotional concepts from the music\\nitself, and (iii) understand how these two interrelate. These\\nthree tasks are detailed below.\\nEliciting the emotional state of the listener Similar to per-\\nsonality traits, the emotional state of a user can be elicited\\nexplicitlyorimplicitly.Intheformercase,theuseristypically\\npresented one of the various categorical models (emotions\\nare described by distinct emotion words such as happiness,\\nsadness, anger, or fear) [84,191] or dimensional models\\n(emotions are described by scores with respect to two or\\nthree dimensions, e.g., valence and arousal) [152]. For a\\nmore detailed elaboration on emotion models in the context\\nof music, we refer to [159,186]. The implicit acquisition of\\nemotional states can be effected, for instance, by analyzing\\nuser-generated text [49], speech [66], or facial expressions\\nin video [55].\\nEmotion tagging in music The music piece itself can be\\nregarded as an emotion-laden content and in turn can be\\ndescribed by emotion words. The task of automatically\\nassigning such emotion words to a music piece is an active\\nresearch area, often refereed to as music emotion recogni-\\ntion (MER), e.g., [14,91,103,187,188,191]. How to integrate\\nsuch emotion terms created by MER tools into a MRS is,\\nhowever, not an easy task, for several reasons.

This is motivated by the\\nassumption that, for instance, a rating prediction of 1 when\\nthe true rating is 4 is much more severe than a prediction of\\n3 for the same item.\\nPrecision at top K recommendations (P@K) is a common\\nmetric that measures the accuracy of the system in command-\\ning relevant items. In order to compute P@K, for each user,\\nthe top K recommended items whose ratings also appear\\nin the test set T are considered. This metric was originally\\ndesigned for binary relevance judgments. Therefore, in case\\nof availability of relevance information at different levels,\\nsuch as a \\ufb01ve-point Likert scale, the labels should be bina-\\nrized, e.g., considering the ratings greater than or equal to 4\\n(out of 5) as relevant. For each user u, Pu@K is computed\\nas follows:\\nPu@K = |Lu \\u2229\\u02c6\\nLu|\\n| \\u02c6\\nLu|\\n(3)\\nwhere Lu is the set of relevant items for user u in the test\\nset T and \\u02c6\\nLu denotes the recommended set containing the\\nK items in T with the highest predicted ratings for the user\\nu. The overall P@K is then computed by averaging Pu@K\\nvalues for all users in the test set.\\nMeanaverageprecisionattopKrecommendations(MAP@K)\\nis a rank-based metric that computes the overall precision of\\nthe system at different lengths of recommendation lists. MAP\\nis computed as the arithmetic mean of the average precision\\nover the entire set of users in the test set. Average precision\\nfor the top K recommendations (AP@K) is de\\ufb01ned as fol-\\nlows:\\nAP@K = 1\\nN\\nK\\n\\u0002\\ni=1\\nP@i \\u00b7 rel(i)\\n(4)\\nwhere rel(i) is an indicator signaling if the ith recommended\\nitem is relevant, i.e., rel(i) = 1, or not, i.e., rel(i) = 0; N\\nis the total number of relevant items. Note that MAP implic-\\nitly incorporates recall, because it also considers the relevant\\nitems not in the recommendation list.17\\nRecall at top K recommendations (R@K) is presented here\\nfor the sake of completeness, even though it is not a crucial\\nmeasure from a consumer\\u2019s perspective. Indeed, the listener\\nis typically not interested in being recommended all or a large\\nnumber of relevant items, rather in having good recommen-\\ndations at the top of the recommendation list. For a user u,\\nRu@K is de\\ufb01ned as:\\n17 Weshouldnotethatintherecommendersystemscommunity,another\\nvariation of average precision is gaining popularity recently, formally\\nde\\ufb01ned by: AP@K =\\n1\\nmin(K,N)\\n\\u0006K\\ni=1 P@i \\u00b7 rel(k) in which N is the\\ntotal number of relevant items and K is the size of recommendation\\nlist. The motivation behind the minimization term is to prevent the AP\\nscores to be unfairly suppressed when the number of recommendations\\nis too low to capture all the relevant items. This variation of MAP was\\npopularized by Kaggle competitions [97] about recommender systems\\nand has been used in several other research works, consider for exam-\\nple [8,124].\\n123\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

While today\\u2019s MRSs\\nconsiderably help users to \\ufb01nd interesting music in these huge catalogs, MRS research is still facing substantial challenges.\\nIn particular when it comes to build, incorporate, and evaluate recommendation strategies that integrate information beyond\\nsimple user\\u2013item interactions or content-based descriptors, but dig deep into the very essence of listener needs, preferences,\\nand intentions, MRS research becomes a big endeavor and related publications quite sparse. The purpose of this trends and\\nsurvey article is twofold. We \\ufb01rst identify and shed light on what we believe are the most pressing challenges MRS research\\nis facing, from both academic and industry perspectives. We review the state of the art toward solving these challenges and\\ndiscuss its limitations. Second, we detail possible future directions and visions we contemplate for the further evolution of\\nthe \\ufb01eld. The article should therefore serve two purposes: giving the interested reader an overview of current challenges in\\nMRS research and providing guidance for young researchers by identifying interesting, yet under-researched, directions in\\nthe \\ufb01eld.\\nKeywords Music recommender systems \\u00b7 Challenges \\u00b7 Automatic playlist continuation \\u00b7 User-centric computing\\nThis research was supported in part by the Center for Intelligent\\nInformation Retrieval.

Thanks to music streaming services\\nlike Spotify, Pandora, or Apple Music, music a\\ufb01cionados\\nare nowadays given access to tens of millions music pieces.\\nBy \\ufb01ltering this abundance of music items, thereby limiting\\nchoice overload [20], MRSs are often very successful to sug-\\ngest songs that \\ufb01t their users\\u2019 preferences. However, such\\nsystems are still far from being perfect and frequently pro-\\nduce unsatisfactory recommendations. This is partly because\\nof the fact that users\\u2019 tastes and musical needs are highly\\ndependent on a multitude of factors, which are not considered\\nin suf\\ufb01cient depth in current MRS approaches, which are typ-\\nically centered on the core concept of user\\u2013item interactions,\\nor sometimes content-based item descriptors.

It there-\\nfore does not come as a surprise that emotion regulation\\nwas identi\\ufb01ed as one of the main reasons why people lis-\\nten to music [122,155]. As an example, people may listen to\\ncompletely different musical genres or styles when they are\\nsad in comparison with when they are happy. Indeed, prior\\nresearch on music psychology discovered that people may\\nchoose the type of music which moderates their emotional\\ncondition [109]. More recent \\ufb01ndings show that music can be\\nmainly chosen so as to augment the emotional situation per-\\nceived by the listener [131]. In order to build emotion-aware\\nMRS, it is therefore necessary to (i) infer the emotional state\\nthe listener is in, (ii) infer emotional concepts from the music\\nitself, and (iii) understand how these two interrelate. These\\nthree tasks are detailed below.\\nEliciting the emotional state of the listener Similar to per-\\nsonality traits, the emotional state of a user can be elicited\\nexplicitlyorimplicitly.Intheformercase,theuseristypically\\npresented one of the various categorical models (emotions\\nare described by distinct emotion words such as happiness,\\nsadness, anger, or fear) [84,191] or dimensional models\\n(emotions are described by scores with respect to two or\\nthree dimensions, e.g., valence and arousal) [152]. For a\\nmore detailed elaboration on emotion models in the context\\nof music, we refer to [159,186]. The implicit acquisition of\\nemotional states can be effected, for instance, by analyzing\\nuser-generated text [49], speech [66], or facial expressions\\nin video [55].\\nEmotion tagging in music The music piece itself can be\\nregarded as an emotion-laden content and in turn can be\\ndescribed by emotion words. The task of automatically\\nassigning such emotion words to a music piece is an active\\nresearch area, often refereed to as music emotion recogni-\\ntion (MER), e.g., [14,91,103,187,188,191]. How to integrate\\nsuch emotion terms created by MER tools into a MRS is,\\nhowever, not an easy task, for several reasons.

This is motivated by the\\nassumption that, for instance, a rating prediction of 1 when\\nthe true rating is 4 is much more severe than a prediction of\\n3 for the same item.\\nPrecision at top K recommendations (P@K) is a common\\nmetric that measures the accuracy of the system in command-\\ning relevant items. In order to compute P@K, for each user,\\nthe top K recommended items whose ratings also appear\\nin the test set T are considered. This metric was originally\\ndesigned for binary relevance judgments. Therefore, in case\\nof availability of relevance information at different levels,\\nsuch as a \\ufb01ve-point Likert scale, the labels should be bina-\\nrized, e.g., considering the ratings greater than or equal to 4\\n(out of 5) as relevant. For each user u, Pu@K is computed\\nas follows:\\nPu@K = |Lu \\u2229\\u02c6\\nLu|\\n| \\u02c6\\nLu|\\n(3)\\nwhere Lu is the set of relevant items for user u in the test\\nset T and \\u02c6\\nLu denotes the recommended set containing the\\nK items in T with the highest predicted ratings for the user\\nu. The overall P@K is then computed by averaging Pu@K\\nvalues for all users in the test set.\\nMeanaverageprecisionattopKrecommendations(MAP@K)\\nis a rank-based metric that computes the overall precision of\\nthe system at different lengths of recommendation lists. MAP\\nis computed as the arithmetic mean of the average precision\\nover the entire set of users in the test set. Average precision\\nfor the top K recommendations (AP@K) is de\\ufb01ned as fol-\\nlows:\\nAP@K = 1\\nN\\nK\\n\\u0002\\ni=1\\nP@i \\u00b7 rel(i)\\n(4)\\nwhere rel(i) is an indicator signaling if the ith recommended\\nitem is relevant, i.e., rel(i) = 1, or not, i.e., rel(i) = 0; N\\nis the total number of relevant items. Note that MAP implic-\\nitly incorporates recall, because it also considers the relevant\\nitems not in the recommendation list.17\\nRecall at top K recommendations (R@K) is presented here\\nfor the sake of completeness, even though it is not a crucial\\nmeasure from a consumer\\u2019s perspective. Indeed, the listener\\nis typically not interested in being recommended all or a large\\nnumber of relevant items, rather in having good recommen-\\ndations at the top of the recommendation list. For a user u,\\nRu@K is de\\ufb01ned as:\\n17 Weshouldnotethatintherecommendersystemscommunity,another\\nvariation of average precision is gaining popularity recently, formally\\nde\\ufb01ned by: AP@K =\\n1\\nmin(K,N)\\n\\u0006K\\ni=1 P@i \\u00b7 rel(k) in which N is the\\ntotal number of relevant items and K is the size of recommendation\\nlist. The motivation behind the minimization term is to prevent the AP\\nscores to be unfairly suppressed when the number of recommendations\\nis too low to capture all the relevant items. This variation of MAP was\\npopularized by Kaggle competitions [97] about recommender systems\\nand has been used in several other research works, consider for exam-\\nple [8,124].\\n123\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"embedding\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"
